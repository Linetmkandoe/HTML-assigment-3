<h1><Summary></Summary></h1>
<h2>Brief welcoming</h2>
<p>In the first day of Akirachix,everything went super smoothly.The welcoming was so warm<br>
due to the love received from the alumni. They helped me sign in and carried my bags,this moved my heart<br>
Later I was taken to my room which was amazingly perfect,everything was in place and in order.<br>
I was later taken to the meeting but unfortunately I was late, though it was still continuing <br>
I sat and initiated my mind to keeping time.The welcoming was amaizingly good, not forgetting the<br>
delicious meal I had.</p>
